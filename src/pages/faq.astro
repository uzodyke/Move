const description = "Get answers to common questions about our moving services. Learn about pricing, booking, insurance, packing, and more. Professional UK moving company FAQ.";

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book my move?",
    answer: "We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance, especially during peak moving seasons (summer months and month-ends). However, we can accommodate short notice and emergency moves when possible. Our 24/7 service means we're available even for same-day emergency relocations."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your moving service?",
    answer: "Our standard service includes professional movers, transportation vehicle, basic packing materials (bubble wrap, tape, protective covers), furniture disassembly and reassembly, loading and unloading, and comprehensive insurance coverage. Additional services like full packing and storage are available."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my belongings insured during the move?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive goods in transit insurance covering your belongings during the entire moving process. We also carry £1M public liability insurance. For high-value items, additional coverage options are available."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide packing materials and services?",
    answer: "Yes, we supply all necessary packing materials including boxes, bubble wrap, packing paper, and tape. We offer full professional packing services, partial packing for fragile items only, or just supply materials if you prefer to pack yourself."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you calculate moving costs?",
    answer: "Costs are based on several factors: property size, distance, access difficulty, number of items, additional services required, and timing. We provide transparent, fixed-price quotes with no hidden charges. Emergency and weekend moves may have additional fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you move internationally?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide international removal services worldwide. We handle customs documentation, shipping arrangements, and can coordinate with international partners. Services include air freight, sea freight, and road transport to Europe."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if something gets damaged?",
    answer: "While rare due to our careful handling, any damage is covered by our comprehensive insurance. We conduct pre-move inventories and inspect items upon delivery. Claims are processed quickly and fairly according to our insurance terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work weekends and holidays?",
    answer: "Yes, we operate 7 days a week including weekends and bank holidays. Our 24/7 emergency service is available for urgent moves. Weekend and holiday moves may incur additional charges but we're committed to accommodating your schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle fragile and valuable items?",
    answer: "We specialize in handling fragile items using professional packing techniques, custom crating for artwork, and specialized equipment for items like pianos. Our team is trained in handling antiques, electronics, and other valuable possessions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer storage services?",
    answer: "Yes, we have secure, climate-controlled storage facilities for both short-term and long-term needs. Our storage is monitored 24/7 with individual unit access. Perfect for moves with timing gaps or downsizing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with office and commercial moves?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in commercial relocations including offices, retail spaces, warehouses, and industrial moves. We work around your business schedule to minimize downtime and can move over weekends or evenings."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept cash, all major credit and debit cards, bank transfers, and can set up business accounts for corporate customers. Payment is typically required upon completion of the move, with deposits possible for large moves."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide moving boxes and where can I get them?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide moving boxes of all sizes along with other packing materials. You can order these in advance or as part of our packing service. We also offer eco-friendly plastic crates as an alternative to cardboard boxes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical move take?",
    answer: "Duration depends on property size and distance. Studio moves typically take 2-4 hours, 2-3 bedroom homes take 4-8 hours, and larger properties may take a full day. Long-distance moves may require multiple days including travel time."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you cover?",
    answer: "We provide moving services throughout the UK including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol, Edinburgh, Liverpool and all surrounding areas. We also cover remote locations and provide international services globally."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pack some items myself?",
    answer: "Certainly! Many customers prefer a hybrid approach - we can pack fragile items and furniture while you handle personal items and clothes. We'll provide materials and guidance for items you pack yourself."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do to prepare for moving day?",
    answer: "We'll provide a comprehensive pre-move checklist, but key steps include: confirming parking arrangements, preparing an essentials box, clearing pathways, backing up computer files, and keeping important documents with you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you dismantle and reassemble furniture?",
    answer: "Yes, our team can disassemble furniture at your old property and reassemble it at your new home. This includes beds, wardrobes, tables, and other flat-pack furniture. We keep all fittings organized and labeled."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with single item moves?",
    answer: "Yes, our Man & Van service is perfect for single item moves, small loads, or furniture delivery. This is a cost-effective option for smaller jobs that don't require a full moving service."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to reschedule my move?",
    answer: "We understand plans can change. We offer flexible rescheduling options with as much notice as possible. While we try to accommodate changes, some fees may apply for last-minute rescheduling depending on circumstances."
